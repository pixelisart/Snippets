# Miscellaneous Code Snippets

This is a collection of various CSS/HTML/JS/etc. snippets I find myself reusing from time to time.

## CSS

* Clearfix, taken from the 960.gs
* Default CSS starter stylesheet
* A flexible way to markup and style forms
* Basic media queries to get you started
* Eric Meyer's reset with a little extra HTML5 fun added
* Tweaked version of Normalize.css
* Image sprites for the Silk Fam Fam Fam icon set


## Date Picker

* Basic date picker setup using Kelvin Luck's date picker plugin. Still the best for me.

## Flexgrid

* A flexible grid system modeled after Nathan Smith's 960 grid.
